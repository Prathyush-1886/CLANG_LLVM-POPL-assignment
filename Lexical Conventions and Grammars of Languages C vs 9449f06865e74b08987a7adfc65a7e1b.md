# Lexical Conventions and Grammars of Languages: C vs. Python vs. Javascript

## Lexical aspects of C :

The various lexical aspects of C are

### Tokens :

A token is the smallest element of a language that is considered as meaningful by the compiler . The tokens in C are further divided into 6 categories identifiers, keywords, constants, string literals, operators and other separators.

We have another collective set known as ' white space ' , whose  members are generally ignored except in the case where they are used to separate tokens. It's members are blanks, horizontal and vertical tabs, newlines, formfeeds and comments.

**Comments:**

Single line comments can be denoted by the ' // '  characters where everything  that is typed after this till the end of the line is treated as a  comment. We can also indicate the beginning of a comment using  " /* " and the end is declared using the " */ " characters, This mainly helps up in writing multi line comments where everything between the "/ * " and " */ " is treated as a comment. In the case we forget to add a " */ " everything from the "/ * " till the end of the program is treated as  a comment.

**Identifiers :**

We define a letter to be the set of letters a-z and their upper case forms and  the special character ' _ " . and the digit is the set of  numbers 0-9.

               letter = { a-z, A-Z, _ }

               digit  = { 0-9 }

An identifier is a sequence of  members of the letter and digit set , where it should always begin with a letter . The uppercase and lowercase letters are different from each other i.e. it is case sensitive.

Regular Expression :   { letter } { letter /  digit }  *     (where letter / digit implies letter or digit )

**Keywords :**

This is a set of predefined set of identifiers which are associated with certain features and the user is not allowed to declare a variable with these identifiers.

They are:

auto       double       int          struct
break      else           long        switch

case        enum        register   typedef
char        extern       return      union
const      float          short       unsigned
continue  for            signed     void
default    goto          sizeof      volatile
do           if               static        while

**Constants :**

A constant refers to fixed value that is cannot be changed throughout the execution of the program. They are divided into types base upon the values that they are meant to hold  .

**Integer Constants :**

An integer constant can be of either of the three types decimal, octal decimal or hexadecimal based on the prefix of the value i.e. a sequence of digits following 0x or 0X is said to be a hexadecimal number, while a number staring with a 0 is said to be an octal decimal number  and not prefixed i.e. normal notation for a decimal number.

The constants can also be suffixed to change their specific types using the letters u , U ,l and L , but this is only applicable to the decimal numbers where 'u' refers to unsigned int ,'U' refers to unsigned long int, 'l' refers to long int and 'L'   unsigned long int.

```c
Examples :
	0123   // an octal decimal number 
	0x14b  // a hexadecimal number
	126u   //unsigned integer 
	126L   //unsigned long integer
```

**Character Constants:**

A character constant is a sequence of character or just one character enclosed within single inverted commas. The value of the  constants that are single characters is their respective numeric value as generated by the ASCII table. The values for the multi-character constants is implementation defined.

```c
Examples:
	'c'
	'M'
	'\t'              //used for tab space
	'\xhh'            //for hexadecimal number
```

**Floating Constants:**

Floating point constants are divided into parts which are the integer part, the decimal part, the fractional part , the exponential part (e or E), an optional signed integer exponent and an optional suffix that helps to change the type of the constant.

The integer and fraction part both consist of only digits, in the constant either the fractional part or integer part may be missing not both and the constant can be expressed in exponential form using e or E or in the decimal from using a decimal point . The suffixes 'f' or 'F' make the constant to be a float whereas the suffixes 'l' or 'L' make it a long double, its default type is double.

```c
Examples:
101.2
1095e-3
1.7856L
```

**String Literals:**

String literals are a sequence of characters that are enclosed within double quotes i.e. "  ". They may also contain various escape sequences which help to represent them.

 

```c
Examples:
"Hello World "
"Hello \n World "
```

## Lexical Aspects of Python :

the various lexical conventions followed in python are :

### Line Structure And Indentation :

The line structure and indentation is one of the most important aspect in python where similar to c the compiler ignores the blank spaces. We are able to write a expression across various lines using the line continuation character " \ ".

The parts of the code that are present in the same block need to have the same indentation where the gap given in the first line of that code block must be followed by all lines in that block. Indentation is the most important component that helps the compiler to distinguish between the various blocks of code for the bodies of the functions, conditional statements, loops etc.

```python
if condition:
		expression1
		expression2
else:
			expression3
			expression4
```

To denote empty blocks we use the keyword pass. 

```python
if condition:
		pass
else:
		expression1
```

### Identifiers and Reserved words

Identifiers and reserved words are similar as in C with the main difference being the list of words that have been declared as the reserved word with few of them similar to C. The main difference between them being that in python the identifiers that begin with underscore '_' tend to have special meanings  such as declaring the access specifiers in OOP's part etc.

 Some of the reserved words are:

and           elif              global            or                yield
assert        else            if                    pass
break        except        import           print
class          exec           in                  raise
continue    finally        is                  return
def            for              lambda        try
del            from           not               while

### Literals

The literals are divided into two parts the string literals and the numeric literals.

The numeric literals are further divided

- Booleans
- Integers
- Long Integers
- Floating point
- Complex Numbers

    In the case of booleans the keyword True and False are interpreted as the boolean values and their respective numeric counterparts being 1 and 0 . The declaration for the integer, long integers and Floating point are same as in C with the same convention , where in the case of long integers need not be followed by their respective suffix and in the case of floating point the suffix part has been omitted . The major addition is the Complex number aspect where an integer or floating point number followed by a 'j' or a 'J' is considered to be the imaginary number and the complex numbers can be creating by joining the real and imaginary parts.

      

    ```python
    True 
    False
    101
    102.34
    101j
    53 + 101j
    ```

The implementation of string literals is also similar to C with the addition being the  ability to support the Unicode format of string literals and the ASCII part being same as C.

The Unicode string are much more complex than ASCII one and allow for the use of 65,536 unique characters. The Unicode string literals consist of the normal strings preceded by a prefix 'u' or a 'U' .

Example :  u "Program"

In Unicode each character of the string is represented by a 16 bit integer value and being represented as a   'u' followed by the 4 digit hexadecimal number. 

Example : P â€” u0050

### Operators, Delimiters and Special symbols

The various operators used are 

 +   -    /    //    %  <     <<   *     >>     &    |

^   ~    and may others 

These operators have various function overloaded so as to be applied to the various data types such as + operator can be used to add two numbers as well as to concatenate two strings.

A delimiter is just one or sequence of characters that are used in the form of a boundary to separate two independent regions in wither plain text or other data streams.

The various delimiters used are:

(     )     {   }   [   ]     ;   ,   .   '     =    :

Some uses of the delimiters is the example of the ' , ' delimiter which is used to separate two arguments in the function input and ' = ' delimiter which separates the variable and the value being assigned to that variable.

### Documentation Strings

During the definition of a function, class or module in the case that a string is present in the first line of its code block this string becomes the documentation string for the associated object.

This documentation string can be accessed using the '__doc__' attribute of the of the respective object in which it is declared. 

```python
Example:

def mult(a,b,c)
	" This function performs a complex operation on the input"
	return (a+b)/c

print mult.__doc__  

output:
 This function performs a complex operation on the input
	
```

### Decorators

Decorators is an interesting aspect in python which comes under the metaprogramming aspect of it. It helps us to add functionality to the respective code. We achieve this by adding a special character '@' to the beginning of the function or method so as to modify its respective behaviour .

```python
Example :

def change( func)
		def pint()
				print "The function has been changed "
				func
		return pint

@change
def prev()
		print " the function "

#  This is equivalent to the code
def prev()
		print " the function "
prev=change(prev)

output:

The function has been changed
the function

```

### Source Code Ending

The source code ending is mainly provided for the users who prefer UNICODE environment as compared to the standard ASCII implementation.

A special comment can be added to the first line of the code so as to write the program in a different encoding .

 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
name = uâ€™M\303\274llerâ€™ # String in quotes is directly encoded in UTF-8.
```

## Lexical Aspects of Javascript :

### Whitespace

Whitespaces refers to the empty spaces, comments and other parts which are generally considered as useless and ignored by the compiler unless in the case where they have been used to separate two tokens which would have been just one token without that white space.

```jsx
var then = now   
// the whitespace between then and var is not ignored while the one after now is ignored
```

The commenting feature in java is similar to that of C where we comment using '//' or the pair '/*' and '*/' . But in the  case of Javascript as it supports the use of Unicode in string literals we avoid the usage of the pair character to signify a block of code and use the '//' characters.

### Names

A name is similar to identifiers in C where they are a sequence starting with a letter followed by a letter or digit or '_' (underscore). The names being used in the programs for variables cannot be one of the reserved words. The reserved words are :

abstract
boolean           break               byte
case                 catch               char          class          const            continue
debugger        default            delete        do            double

else                 enum              export        extends
false                final                finally        float          for               function
goto
if                   implements      import       in            instanceof     int             interface
long
native           new                   null
package        private              protected     public
return
short             static                super           switch          synchronized
this              throw                throws          transient      true         try         typeof
var               volatile              void
while           with

Names are used for the statements , variables , parameters, property names, operators and labels.

### Numbers

Number is a data type that is used to refer to all forms of numbers that had been divided in C such as integers, floating point and so on, it is internally denoted using a 64 bit value. This allows for the equality of numbers like 1 and 1.0 . This common data type helps to reduce a large number of numeric errors . The keyword NaN  is treated as the result of an operation/function that cannot produce a normal result.

### Strings

The string literals are implemented in JavaScript in the Unicode 16 bit format where each character is 16 bit wide. Since there is no special character variable as in C to get a character literal in JavaScript we just make a string that contains only one character . The escape sequences similar to C allow us to enter character into the string that would have not been permitted.

For Example : double quotes, back slash etc.

These are added using the format \u  where u helps us indicate the respective character code point.

The conversion of character to Unicode format is similar to that of python(Unicode format)

For Example :          C=== 'u0043'   ,   "CA" = u " \u0043\u0041 "

The strings in JavaScript are immutable i.e. once a value has been assigned to a string variable it cannot be changed and '+' operator supports concatenation of strings.

### Statements

In simple terms statements can be considered to be the programming commands/ instruction that are to be executed by the program.

 The statements are separated from each other using semicolons. Statements are executed in top to down fashion in the program, with 'var'  statement being used to declare the local variables inside a block of code (enclosed within curly { } brackets ). 

Few examples for some fixed form statements are :

- if statement
- do statement
- while statement
- for statement
- try statement    etc.

### Expressions

In simple terms we consider an expression to be anything that can be resolved to a value. This resolving of a value can be roughly divided three parts where they represent a literal/built-in value , an expression which can have side effects i.e. an assignment operator containing expression and a simple mathematical expression which can be reduced to a value by applying the respective operations indicated by the operators.

```jsx
Examples :
a=b+c
(a/b) ? c:d 
(a + b )/ c
```

The precedence for the operators that are used to create the different expressions is as follows (Their precedence reducing as we go from top to bottom ) :

- .    [ ]      (  )
- delete   new  typeof    +    -     !          (these are the unary operators)
- *    /        ?
- +    -
- â‰¥    â‰¤    >   <
- ===   !==
- &&
- | |
- ? :

### Literals

Literals are a convenient notation  often used to initialize the  variables that have been declared/ created. These names that have been given to the respective objects  are treated as literal names and not variable names and as a result they have to be mentioned at compile time. The values to these properties can be assigned through expressions.

They can be further divided into :

- number literal
- string literal
- object literal
- array literal
- function
- regexp literal

### Functions

The function literal is said to represent a certain function value and this is divided into 3 parts , the name of the function the arguments that have to be passed to the function and the body of the function that is made up of statements.

# Transition Diagrams

## Rules:

- You start from the left set of vertical line and move through the path to reach the right set of vertical lines.
- A single vertical line  means we allow the insertion of a whitespace between any pair of tokens while a double vertical line implies we don't.
- The paths are in a such a way that they can be taken only if they appear to diverge (concave) at the point of contact between the paths while keeping the direction of arrival in mind. In the case that a path appears to converge(convex) at a point with another path it cannot be taken from the path it converges with.

## Whitespace (Pgno. 6)

This transition diagram helps us to get a better idea of basically what components are considered to be a white space where each route taken depends upon what we have encountered.

In the beginning it is divided into 3 paths where a space , tab or empty is treated as a white space and the 4th path is what is started upon reading a slash, if this is followed by another slash this line becomes a comment and we keep looping at this part over all characters present after it  till we reach the end of the line and this whole part is considered to be a whitespace. In the case we encounter a ' * ' after the first slash this indicates the start of  a block comment  and all the characters that appear after this are ignored, including individual '/' or '*' i.e. don't appear together ; as they are a part of the comment only upon reaching the pair  ' */ ' do we say that the comment has ended and we return back to the beginning in the case another slash or space or tab is encountered else we exit the transition diagram.

## Names (Pgno. 7)

The transition diagram basically explains the structure that forms the syntax for a name.

We see that there is only one option upon starting which indicates that the starting symbol for a name must be a letter and this letter can be followed by any number of letters or digits or underscore's which is indicated by the 4 paths available after the 1st letter which indicates what follows it or it just ends at that point . Similarly after every '_' or digit there are two paths one where there is another symbol or the name has ended.

 

## Numbers (Pgno. 7,  Pgno. 8)

The transition diagram clearly shows that the number should always start with an integer and  this integer can be followed by a fraction , exponent where either one could appear , two could appear or none( indicated by the path around fraction and exponent) .  

The respective descriptions for integers, fractions and exponents is shown by the given transition diagrams.

### Integer

In the integer diagram we see that upon encountering a 0 at the beginning we reach the end as a 0 followed by any digits indicates a octal number else it is just 0. In the case that a digit other than 0 is present we read that and keep looping through the digits till we reach the end and then exit it . This clearly indicates that an integer can be 0 or a string of digits not starting with 0.

### Fraction

In the fraction diagram the first this we see is a decimal point  after which there is a loop that consists of reading through all the digits appearing after the decimal point and once all digits are read we exit the diagram. This indicates that fractional part is of the form '  . X*  '  where X={0-9} .

### Exponent

In the exponential diagram we see that the syntax can start with either a 'e' or a 'E'  followed by a division of paths for whether the exponent is negative or positive  , followed by a loop for all the digits that occur leading to the exponent value. This is of the form {e/E }{+/-} X*   where / indicate either one of those.

 

## Strings (Pgno. 9)

### String Literal

The first transition diagram is for the syntax of strings where the first two paths show that a string can start with either a double quote or a single quote and end with the same one. The paths indicated after them show that there is also a possibility of an empty string. The path then diverges as there is possibility of either encountering a UNICODE character  or a escaped character and we keep looping through these till we reach the end of the string i.e. the counter part of the starting quote character i.e. double quote for double quote and single quote for single quote. Once we reach the end we exit the transition diagram.

### Escaped character

The second transition diagram is for the escaped character which shows that they should always begin with a backslash followed by the respective requirement that tells its function . The escaped character is of the  form ' \ x  '   where x can be ", ' , \ , /, f, n, u+4 digit hexacode and so on that help the print function to print the respective requirement at that instant like newline, tab and so on.

## Statements (Pgno. 10)

This transition diagram describes the syntax for var statements .

The single vertical line clearly indicates that the appearance of white spaces between the tokens is tolerated in var statements.

The initial two paths that we have shows that a var statement is either empty or starts with a var. In the case that it begins with a var  which is followed by declaration of a name and then either assigning a value to that name using an expression or just declaring it and moving on, in the case that a comma is encountered we go back and take the next name , we repeat this till the semi colon is reached which indicates the end of the statement. After the semicolon we see that there are again two paths i.e. either another var  is encountered and we repeat the process again or no var is encountered and we exit the transition diagram.
