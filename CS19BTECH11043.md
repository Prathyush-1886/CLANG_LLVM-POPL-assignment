## C++11/C++14 features used :

- **Template:**

Template being one of the most powerful tools in C++ has been widely used in the declaration of various data structures as well as operators so as to easily extend them to various data types thereby making the code much simpler to write as well as efficient.

Templates work on the idea that data types have to be sent in as input parameters so that the same code need not be written for various data types.

- __virtual const char* name() const noexcept = 0;__

This is a pure virtual member function of the class error_category ,that is defined in the derived classes and returns a string (C-string) naming the category.

In the [generic_category](http://www.cplusplus.com/generic_category) object, it returns "generic".

In the [system_category](http://www.cplusplus.com/system_category) object, it returns "system".

In the [iostream_category](http://www.cplusplus.com/iostream_category)  object, it returns "iostream".

- **Overloading:**

The overloading feature of C++ has been used a lot which allows us to overload the function or operators which allows the existence of two or more functions or operators in the same name scope.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/functional](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/functional)

- **Memory allocation using new and delete:**

These operators allow the user to dynamically allocate memory i.e. allows the programmer to allocate the memory manually. The memory for dynamic allocation is allocated from the heap whereas in the case of non-static and local variables the memory is allocated from the stack.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/src/new.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/src/new.cpp)

- **Auto :**

The auto keyword is a powerful toll that allows the type of the variable declared as an auto to be deduced from its initializer and for functions of return type auto  they will be evaluated at runtime by the return type expression.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/Analysis/iterator-modeling.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/Analysis/iterator-modeling.cpp)

- __Virtual const char* what() const noexcept():__

This is a public member function of the exception class that may be used to identify a given exception. The representation that is pointed to by the return value is based on the implementation, and due to it being a virtual function the derived classes can redefine the function so as to return specific values.

This has a no throw guarantee i.e. this member function never generates an exception.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/src/any.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/src/any.cpp)

- **Atomic Library:**

The atomic library has also been used which allows us to do fine grained atomic operations which allow for lockless concurrent programming. Atomic objects are free from data races due to the fact that each atomic operation is indivisible with respect to any other atomic operation that involves the same object(atomic).

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/src/atomic.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/src/atomic.cpp)

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/src/ios.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/src/ios.cpp)

- **Thread Library:**

This allows the user to create multiple threads and enter into the realm of parallel programming. Along with this various other libraries like those for mutex locks, semaphores etc. were also implemented . 

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/thread](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/thread)

## Class Hierarchy:

Classes possess the same hierarchy as in C++ along with the access control options between the classes. We are allowed to create derived classes for various classes and also allow us to create various derived classes from a given base /parent class.

Only the members of the parent class that have been classified as either protected or public are what can be accessed by the derived classes.

The derived classes have the members of the parent class as well as their own members.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.derived/p1.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.derived/p1.cpp)

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.derived/p2.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.derived/p2.cpp)

**Inheritance:**

This property is also similar to that of C++ which allows classes to be derived from other classes thereby allowing them to possess the members of the parent class as well as their own members.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.derived/p1.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.derived/p1.cpp)

## OOP design decisions for LLVM:

The object oriented programming portion of LLVM is similar to that of C++ which uses classes to simulate objects and defines the methods to operate on these classes inside them.

- **Classes** :

Usage of classes is similar to that of C++ with defining their members and methods, an object can be declared of that class like a variable declaration. While declaring its members deciding their access control/specificity is also necessary.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class/p6-0x.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class/p6-0x.cpp)

- **Access control:**

Access control i.e. private, public or protected is applied uniformly to all the names ,independent of the fact that they are from declarations or expressions. In the case of function overloading ,the access control  is applied to the function selected by the overload resolution.

The various errors that occur during class derivation during the process of method overwriting in the case of the method being declared as a private have been described here along with errors generated by attempts to change the access specifier of a method during inheritance.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.access/p4.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.access/p4.cpp)

All these access controls that have been defined affect the ability to access these class member names from a particular scope. Access controls appear as usual to the member names accessed as a part of a function's return type even though we can’t determine the access privileges of that call without parsing through the rest of the function.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.access/p6.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/CXX/class.access/p6.cpp)

- **Encapsulation:**

This method has also been given priority especially in the ‘.h’ files where this property prevents the user from manipulating the values stored in the objects directly and only allows them to manipulate them using the methods present in the objects thereby preventing few data manipulation mistakes from happening and  also ensuring you have better control over the data.

- **Polymorphism:**

During the process of inheritance this property allows the derived classes to overload either the functions or any operator so as to perform a different function as compared to the base class.

## Design Patterns:

The design pattern for the codes makes it easy to understand the various elements of the code where the various components used in the code have the respective library included which included the function used in the program.

The codes are divided into two parts the ‘.h’ files and 2 ’.cpp’ files, where the functions of a specific library are declared in the .h file ,defined in one .cpp file and used by including the library in the other .cpp file and compiling the .cpp file where the functions have been defined along with this.

This allows for cleaner code to be written and for the user  to be able to share their created data structures so as to allow other users to use them.

The usage of encapsulation and method interaction in the used data structures allows the user to use the data structures without needing to know about their inner workings, as well as prevent the user from directly manipulating the data. This allows the user to use the required data structures using the predefined methods whose function is simple to understand. 

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/vector](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/vector)

## Usage of iterators and their own data structures:

- **Iterators:**

Iterators are pointers which point to the respective memory addresses of the STL containers. They are primarily used when the container contains a sequence of data (like characters, strings, integers etc.).They help in reducing the complexity as well as the processing time of a respective program.

They help us to iterate through the data elements of the container for example in the case of an array we can iterate through the nodes by simply doing a ' itr++ '(where itr is the iterator) as the elements are contiguous in memory.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/vector](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/vector)

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/Analysis/iterator-modeling.cpp](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/clang/test/Analysis/iterator-modeling.cpp)

- **Data Structures:**

Creation of data structures is similar to how it is done in C++ with the use of both structures and classes or just one of them. As the properties of these remains the same the application of pointers in the creation of linked list and so on remains along with the ability to control the accessibility of their members.

Few of the implemented data structures are:

**Vectors:**

Vectors possess the same properties as in C++ i.e. they are dynamic arrays that possess the ability to  resize themselves accordingly when an element is added or removed with this resizing being taken care of by the container.

The elements can be of various types like strings, integers and so on this being made possible using the application of templates. The elements stored are present in a contiguous block of memory that allows us to iterate through the vector to access the elements.

[https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/vector](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libcxx/include/vector)

**Maps:**

Maps are a type of containers used in C++ that consists of two values, key and mapped value where each key is associated with a mapped value, two keys can have the same mapped value but two mapped values cannot have the same key value.

We implement the mapping feature present in 'c++' using vectors and define them from the base using templates and vectors. It is also implemented to allow us to map from symbols to strings or other objects , where the symbol conversion to a integer is considered to be slow if done using a toString() so we use parallel-for.
